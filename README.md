## 📦 About

This repo is **not** the app source code.  
Instead, it serves as a **distribution hub** for generated builds —  
ideal for testers, students, and admin users who need quick access to the latest APK versions.

Each build is automatically tagged and uploaded as a **GitHub Release**, named after the app’s version in `pubspec.yaml`.
